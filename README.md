# Fake News Detection Using Transformer-Based Deep Learning Models on the ISOT Dataset

# Aim
This project aims to design, develop, and deploy an efficient fake news classification system using transformer-based deep learning algorithms trained on the ISOT dataset, enabling accurate detection of fake and real news articles through an interactive Gradio-based web application. 

# Objectives
1. To study the problem of fake news dissemination and understand its impact on information credibility in digital media.
2. To explore and preprocess the ISOT Fake News Dataset, including data cleaning, text normalization, and label preparation for model training.
3. To implement transformer-based deep learning models for effective feature extraction and text classification.
4. To train and evaluate the transformer models using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. To develop an interactive user interface using the Gradio application, ensuring usability, responsiveness, and reliability.
6. To demonstrate the practical applicability of transformer-based deep learning techniques in combating misinformation.
